All historians put together a _story or narrative_ of their best possible explination of what happened by looking at the evidence and analyzing it. Look at the American Revolution; historians take journal entries, military documents, and eye witnesses account to piece together a narrative of what happened and why. This narrative is presented as _historical truth_. But the questions that these trusted narratives could have holes is where **historiography** comes into play. Those holes that we are looking for is personal, political, or religious bias or leaving out researched material because it doesn't fit into the decided upon narrative. The best example of these blemishes is looking at the **Bible**. 

Many view The Bible as one of the most influential books ever written due to its impact on shaping some cultures, but it is also one of the most disputed works as well. The Bible is one of those subjects that a majority of people have a strong opinion about, both positive and negavite. It is these strong emotonial ties that make the Bible a perfect fit to be the subject of a _historiographical study_. This essay will take a glance at two major aspects of historiography. First we will take a closer look at the historians who researched and wrote about the Bible. Then go through a timeline of how perspectives and interpretations of the Bible have changed over time, specifically in terms of how developments in science have created these shifts. 

### From Prophets to Historians
        
_Is the Bible history?_ This question sparks some of the most heated debated when talking about the Bible. Making a statement that the Bible is a accurate historical account means that all the stories in the Bible happened exactly as they are described. This statement is called [**Biblical inerrancy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_inerrancy) and means that there is no errors in the Bible. As one can imagine this claim comes with a lot of resistance and is one that can't be proven, but is that the only way we can look at the Bible?

Looking at the Bible as a work of history, just as one would read a book on WWII or the JFK assassination, takes the pressure off of the point of Biblical inerrancy. The Bible can be viewed as a _historical narrative_ that is how a group of historians think events happened based on the evidence that they value the most. This places the big names of the Bible such as [Moses](https://www.ancient.eu/Moses/), [David](https://www.britannica.com/biography/David), [Daniel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_(biblical_figure)), and so on in the category of historians. Viewing the Bible from that direction makes a historiographical assesment easier to put together. 

The biggest criticism when talking about the Bible is the obvious bias that these historians/prophets would have when writing their respective books of the Bible. These prophets have not only devoted their lives to God but their lives on the line to carry his message of [hope and salvation](https://billygraham.org/decision-magazine/december-2013/the-hope-of-salvation/) into hostile situations. Their bias is clear and is safe to say that they would be less likely to include instances or stories that would tarnish God's name.

With the critism of Biblical inerrency comes the idea that some of the more harder to believe stories in the Bible are refered to as **interpreted history**. This means that not everything is historically accurate; the authors main focus is to convey information that is important to their cause or religious beliefs. If the events didn't happen the way they were described and are included for the simple use of emphasising an ideal or characteristics of God then the authors credibility will take a hit. Another classification of stories thought to be included in the Bible is **etiologies**. These stories are thought to be fictional accounts that explain various phenomenon. A good example of is the story of the [Tower of Babel](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tower-of-Babel) and how that accounts for the dispersal of different languages around the world. 
These are some of the things one needs to think about when embarking on a historical assessment when reviewing a historians work. Reading between the lines and looking for what wasn't said can sometimes carry more weight than what was actually said. 

### Modern Day Sources

No matter what topic a person is researching they need to wary of every source they come into contact with. The importance of this skill is heightened when looking at topic as decisive as the _Bible and the its relationship with science_. When looking for any information reguarding the Bible one would expect to comes across a fair amount of soucres that have a religious affiliation with a Church or other religious groups. A source with this type of affiliation is bound to filled with information that is supportive towards the Bible and God. While you should proceed with caution these types of sources do have some use in gaining understanding the Biblical point of view. These sources will be quick to cut out any information that doesn't support the overall narrative that religious groups want to promote.

On the flip side almost the exact same things could be said about sources that heavily leans towards the scientific point of view or written by scientists themselves. Science tends to be straight forward and everything has explanation or a solution that can be tested for. Inability to prove or disprove most Biblical claims is what causes tension for science because the Bible represents a variable that science can't test. These scientific sources are a valuable piece of information due to their unparalleled access and insight into the finding and advancements of science, but their need to have absolute answers can sometimes lead them to make dubious claims. 

The historical sources used for this essay underwent the same, intense scrutiny when guaging what to look out for during my research. The first source I used to by _J.B. Stump Science and Christianity Introduction of the Issues_. In his acknowledgments Stump mentions his involvment in a foundation, **Biologos**, that advocates _harmony between science and biblical faith_. This foundation puts themselves right in the middle of the Bible/Science debate and sets the idea that both can co-exist with miminal problems. Investigating further there is a slight hint of bias towards the Biblical side of things with more pastors and Christian thinkers speaking. Stump also mentions his Christian heritage being passed down from multiple generations. This sets up this source in a pro-Bible light. Reading through the inital reaction holds true with a slight favor towards Christianity. 

Stump goes heavy into different theories of interpretations of the Bible over time. He includes a lot of philosphers and scientists who help drive the changing thoughts on the Bible. Showcasing what the elite of society thought dismisses the effect on the general public. While he does a great job of noting the changes of interpretations of the Bible due to scientific discoveries, these advancements take a backseat to their affect on the Bible and doesn't include other societal factors that could play a role in this change. Stumps overall connections between the Bible and understanding the world we live in is a **micro**, small, focus on a big, complex issue. 

A source for that landed on the pro-science side of the arguement was a compilation of work from different authors in _Science and Religion in the 21st Century._ A majority of the authors involved come from a science background so the intial thought was pro-science. Most of the topics of discussion were more science focused. The topics discussed were older than one would think when talking about troubles in the 21st century. I was expecting more recent topics that are debated in todays world. Just like the previous source the bottom line was the arguement for co-existence.

With some background of how to examine sources we can look at the varying degree of influence and changing perception of the Bible, as affected by Science. 

### Starting point

To effectively show the shifts of change we first need to establish a starting point. To set the foundation we will look at how ancient societies and empires saw themselves and other empires in large scale of history. Their early way of thinking was referred to as **cyclical history**. Cyclical history views human history much like that of cylces we see in the natural world. Think of the changing of seasons or the cycles of the moon. Relating it to human history the cycle starts with the birth an empire. The cycle continues with the empires rise to prominence and ends with its eventual demise. Ancient philosopher Plato was a key proponent for this theory. 

>"Have not thousands upon thousands of city-states come into existence, and .... have not just as many perished." (Lemon, 32)

While this cyclical outlook carried on into the Roman empire the Romans felt themselves immune from the vicious cycle as seen before them. This thought process was labeled **Rome Eternal** and looking back we see this as fools gold. In [410 AD Rome was sacked](https://www.britannica.com/event/Sack-of-Rome-410) by a group of Visigothic barbarian's. Even though Rome wasn't the captial city during this time Rome was still seen as the identifying city. The invaders laid waste to the city, albeit by way of an open gate, and left Romans looking for answers. This led to the blaming of Christians as the cause of their trouble.

Christians bore the brunt of the heat for the sacking because of their refusal to sacrifice to pagan gods. Christian philospher [St. Augustine]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) combated these claims by writing the book _City of God_. In this he defended his Christians brothers and pointed the blame towards Romes lack of morals as the main source of their misfortune. This book also led to a new, **linear** way of looking at history. 

Instead of the endles cycles of highs and lows the linear way of looking at history puts everyone on the path of a straight line. On this path, St. Agustine argues, starts out in the **City of Man**. This is the earthly world that we all inhabit at this very moment. Our main purpose in the City of man is to atone for your sins so to gain entrance into the **City of God**. In this philosphy the building of wealth and knowledge along with pursuit of progress was second behind doing what has to be done for the City of God. 

This is the foundation of the influence of the Bible, setting up a culture that has a sole purpose of passing through heavens gates. While not everyone bought in Christianity did become the major religion of Ancient Rome. This is the high point on our timeline for Christanity and the Bible as we will see a slow decent of its influence and its perspective of absolute truth will be questioned. 

### Scientific Revoluion

Progess is seen as the measurement by which a society is seen as successful. In the 16th and 17th centuries there was a time called the Scientific Revolution that saw an incredible amount of advancements in the field of science. These advancements swayed people away from the ancient authority that was blindly followed without question. The Bible was one of the ancient authorities that went without question. It was seen as a guide to understanding the natural world we live in. 

The challenges to the ancient authorities didn't happen overnight. The courage and acceptence to ask the challenging questions happening gradually over time. The perfect example to showcase this change it looking at the process of determining the sun is the center of the universe.

  image-url="bvs2.png"
  source-url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentrism"
%}

[Claudius Ptolemy]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy) was a Greek astronomer who is credited coming up with a [**Geocentrism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model) model of the universe. His view of the galaxy was aided by the Bible and the literal perception, at that time.  

>Joshua 10:13: “And the sun stood still and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.” 

In this verse Joshua and his men were engaged in battle and were winning, by a large margin. But Joshua was against the clock as the sun was due to set and darkness would cover the battlefield. Joshua, not wanting to give up his advantage prayed for God to keep the sun still so he could staying fighting in the light and finish off the enemy. God obliged and that is where we get the Bible verse Joshua 10:13. In reading this verse scholars thought it made sense with Ptolemy's view of the galaxy becuase it would be easy for God to have to sun, thought to be orbiting the earth, be still for a short period of time. 

This understanding of the heavens would be the final authority, that is until the [Coperincan Revoluion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_Revolution). Nicolas Copernicus made some observation that differed from what Ptolemy had claimed. Copernicus had made the discovery of a [**Heliocentrism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism) where the sun is the center, but there was little he could do because one didn't challenge the ancient authorities. He was so worried about what a challenge like this could mean that he didn't publish he findings, _On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres_, until later in his life.

Copernicus fears were not unwarrented because his book was banned the Church, but his efforts didn't go to waste. [**Galileo**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei) would carry the tourch and continue what Coperincus started. In his observations he agreed with the Heliocentric model and also put the sun in the center of the universe with everything orbiting around it. Like Coperinicus he also faced opposition from the chruch. He was forced to recant his claims in effort to silence his opposing views.

This example shows how the tides of change were upon both the Bible and Science. Advancments were seen in science and progress was the result. Holding the Bible as authority on the natural world was deeply questioned due to science offering a different perspective. The Bible had competition and it was gaining a lot of steam. Scientific answers to questions were making sense and planting seeds of doubt in the Bible. There was also qustions on how one should look at and interept the Bible. Until now the Bible was take as a literal truth, what it says is what happened. Theologians had to come up with different answers   


### Different Ways of Interepting the Bible

Biblical philosophy was pushed into a different direction when looking at and trying to understand the Bible. The shift was away from the literal translation. This change in thought was highlighted by **Averroes** and his **double truth theory**. Averroes was a muslim philosopher, and one of the most important Arab thinkers of the Middle ages. “The doctrine of double truth meant that a claim could have different meanings at different levels- a literal philosophical meaning and an allegorical or figurative theological meaning.” (Stump, pg 9)

[**Origen of Alexandria**](https://www.iep.utm.edu/origen-of-alexandria/) was one of the great Christian theologians of his time and he was also on the side of getting away from a literal interpretation. Origen had argued that both the world and scripture have embedded within them potent symbols. “The relationship (between the invisible and the visibly) does not obtain only with creatures, the Divine Scripture itself is written with wisdom of a rather similar sort.” (Harrison, pg 19) Origen made a claim that certain passages of scripture have no literal sense at all, and that others, when taken literally, could reasonably be dismissed as ‘absurd and impossible.’ (Harrison, pg 19)

The step away from the literal interpretation left a gap in the Bible and its relationship to the natural world. This gap was quickly filled in by the **Two Books** metaphor. This metaphor states that God gave mankind information, or revelation, through different, but coordinated sources. The first source is the Bible, while the other one is the world (God’s creation). This metaphor appealed to the masses because not everyone knew how to read, or had the scriptures available to them, however one does not need to know how to read to observe the beauty of God’s creation.

All of these paradigm shifts or changing of philosphies of looking at the Bible was spurned on by the advancement of knowledge in the pursuit of science. The more that was understood about the world the more the perception of the Bible changed. Skeptism started to creep into the minds of some and opposition to the Bible became more frequent. 
   

### Change In America 

America is a country founded on the Bible. As the country grew socities were built around the Bible and it was held in high reguard. Much like in the days of Copernicus one didn't challenge the authority of the Bible. Even though the world's progress was full steam ahead there was still a spot for the Bible in popular culture. In 1925 the authority of the Bible was challenged by a teacher in Tennessee by the name of [John Scopes](https://www.history.com/topics/roaring-twenties/scopes-trial). In his classroom he taught the [theory of evoluion](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/theory-evolution/) opposite the Biblical narrative of creation. This was front page news and got national attention. People were shocked that someone as trusted as teacher could challenge something as holy as the Bible. This was a turning point for America because gave science the opening to be opposite the authority of Bible and get people to listen. 

A more modern look at the perception of the Bible shows that it is still revered by most of the country. According to a 2016 poll by [_Answers in Gensis_]( https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2016/07/06/new-barna-study-biblical-skepticism-rise/when) asked if any book is considered holy or sacred the Bible was the top choice. According to that same survey a question was asked it the Bible contains everything a person needs to live a meaningful life. 45% but that was down from 5 years ago. The part that stands out is the people that disagree with that statement has risen 10%, 23 to 33. This shows that skeptism for the Bible is growing in America and it is not held in high reguard, as it used to be. The perception of the Bible being a key component to life is an idea of the past. Looking at the source we see it being a pro-biblical sources so the for them to report stats that hurt their cause says a lot. It also makes you wonder who they are surveying. Might the numbers change even more depending on who is conducting the survey and the makeup of people taking the survey.

For scholars and students of the history of the Third Reich, a striking aspect of the period remains the degree of compliance and even complicity exhibited by the German people as a whole. Intellectuals were not exempt in this regard. Far from simply being swept-away by events beyond their control, they and historians in particular held great power in shaping the cultural milieu of the Weimar era (c. 1918-1933). The conservative, anti-republican atmosphere they helped foster ultimately proved to be amenable to takeover by far-right authoritarianism. Though many historians managed to keep themselves aloof of the new regime’s agenda, they did so at a cost, and the discipline did not escape the Nazi phenomenon unscathed.

## Weimar Historiography


German universities were world-renowned and long considered some of the best as pillars of serious scholarship and free association. German professors were held in great esteem by the public and could easily enter decision-making roles in German society if they wished (Sims, 247). In a 1951 survey, for example, the most prestigious profession was chosen by Germans as that of the university professor (Dahrendorf, 81). In light of this commanding prestige, German professors were in prime position to encourage opposition to the Nazi movement and later to the regime, particularly historians as the foremost scholars of the relationship between power and the state (Sims, 247).

In spite of this, the reaction of historians to the crumbling of German democracy and the establishment of a one-party dictatorship was rather muted. Although not a single professor of history was a member of the Nazi party before 1933 (Lambert, 555), none left voluntarily after the takeover and there were only very limited dismissals by Nazi officials, mostly of Jewish professors (Schulze, 25, 28). There was no need for a widespread “purge.” Only a handful of historians deviated from the conservative consensus of the profession, a consensus that proved amply compatible with the fiercely nationalist, virulently anti-semitic National Socialist (_Nationalsozialismus_ or "Nazi") movement.

### A Bitter Defeat

Historiography of the interwar years in Germany was dominated by the trauma of the First World War, but especially by the offspring of its conclusion: the [Treaty of Versailles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles). In the minds of German historians, as well as much of the German people, the Treaty represented an inconceivable humiliation for a country which had been at the high point of its power just four years before. Not only was it considered an extremely harsh punishment, but also an unjust one as it pinned the blame for the war unfairly, it was thought, on Germany alone (Evans, “The Coming” 60).

The [Weimar Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic), itself a consequence of the defeat and the years of chaos and sociopolitical revolution that followed, thus became the target of conservative and nationalist resentments. Most historians shared these sentiments, or were at best “republicans of the head and not of the heart” (Schulze, 21). As makers and “custodians of the national memory,” historians were essential in building post-WWI national consciousness (Sims, 248-249). Historians wrote of the “hereditary enemy” of France, the return of Alsace-Lorraine (a border region ceded to France in 1918), and created a corpus of so-called “border research” that aimed [revanchist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revanchism) sentiments at France and Poland (Schleier, 180). Many historical works of the period attempted to “revise” the Treaty, criticised democracy and the Weimar constitution, and in general demanded a revival of nationalist consciousness mixed with a militant, revanchist spirit (Schulze, 21).

### *Völkische* History

It was in this intellectual climate post-1918 that the late-nineteenth century notion of [‘*Volk*’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lkisch_movement) (an objective grouping of people with a shared ethnicity, language and culture) became increasingly more influential (180). ‘**_Volksgeschichte_’ (people’s or ethnic history)** was created by the combination of racial theories with ‘*volkstum*’ (people’s character), ideas connected to traditions and culture. This “holistic folk history” became so influential as to rival the traditional grounding of the state as the preeminent object of historical analysis (Schulze, 22).

A new methodology was required to explore this emerging historical paradigm. Methods were adopted from ethnography, settlement studies, and more detailed analysis was made of local customs, social, and economic histories. German historians of the Weimar years thus combined a more empirical methodology with revisionist political ends (22), a trend that expanded from 1918 onward and especially after 1933 under the auspices of the Nazi state (Schleier, 181).

### Conservative-Nationalist "Objectivity"

All of this appears to be in contradiction of the values of the self-professed “objective” German historian, the vast majority of whom were steeped in late-nineteenth century positivist thought and greatly influenced by two German intellectual titans: the sociologist **Max Weber** (c. 1864-1920) and the historian **Leopold von Ranke** (c. 1795-1886). Both promoted **objectivity** in scholarship and warned against the imposition of personal, contemporary values on times past. Political partisanship in the classroom was also looked down upon, Weber himself stating publicly in 1918 that “politics is out of place in the lecture room” (Sims, 250). Contrastingly, twenty-three years prior at his inaugural address at Freiberg in 1895, Weber had expressed his own nationalist leanings by characterizing the unification of Germany as a “youthful prank,” urging the young nation to continue forward after what seemed like a pause in national progress (Evans, “The Coming” 39).

For German historians of the interwar years, conservative-nationalist proclivities thus lined up conspicuously well with notions of “objectivity” in historical scholarship. It was self-evident to them that the Weimar Republic represented a clear break with German history. Democracy, republicanism, and liberalism were not compatible with the German sense of *volk* and country, as was supposedly “proved” by the social unrest and political chaos that followed the collapse of the Wilhelmine Reich. “The Kaiser-less time,” was widely considered “the terrible time,” in the words of historian Conrad Bornhak (Sims, 253).

### Objectivity Versus Impartiality

All this was contemporaneous to the professionalization of history as a discipline, which more often required extensive technical training. Indeed, the historian [Gustav Droysen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gustav_Droysen) proclaimed that history should be raised to the “rank of a science” (Iggers, 19), defending objectivity on the one hand while rejecting [positivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism) in historical scholarship (the search for deterministic historical laws) on the other (Daston, 32).

  image-url="mmendoza-leopold-von-ranke.jpg"
  source-url="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Leopold_Von_Ranke_1877.jpg"
%}
Another German historian, [Heinrich von Sybel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_von_Sybel), who had studied under Ranke and founded the *Historische Zeitschrift* (a leading German historical journal) rejected Ranke’s impartiality entirely, calling it “cold” and “colorless.” Along those same lines, historian [Georg Gervinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Gottfried_Gervinus) simply said it was a sign of “political impotence” (31). At the same time as rejecting impartiality, however, these historians affirmed the objectivity of their discipline. How could this be so?

Historical objectivity was conceived as embodied by the methodologies of historical investigation--it was through a systematic process of '**_Quellenkritik_' (source criticism)** that perspectives, context, and bias were identified and critiqued. Thus, regardless of the ends to which historical investigation was applied, political or otherwise, it was the methodological rigor of the historian’s process that made the work “objective” (32). Though the notion of impartiality was mocked by some historians such as [Heinrich von Treitschke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_von_Treitschke) as “eunuchry” for the “refusal to put history at the service of life,” this did not preclude them from imagining their historical work as fundamentally objective (33). Utilizing history in the service of present realities was an idea that would only grow in the coming years.

(Ayçoberry, 3)

## Historiography Under the Nazis

Through the death throes of the Weimar Republic, as the Nazis gained steadily in the polls and political violence escalated on the streets, German historians became gradually more uneasy. But Rankean ideals of impartiality alongside a general contempt for democracy subdued most as the Republic collapsed. Few spoke out against the Nazis, notably the historians [Gerhard Ritter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Ritter) (c. 1888-1967) and [Friedrich Meinecke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Meinecke) (c. 1862-1954), both of whom broke their silence to urge people to vote for Hindenburg over Hitler. Hans Rothfels, himself dismissed from a chair at Königsberg by the Nazis in 1934, condemned as “deeply shameful” what he called the “voluntary coordination” of silence among professors (Sims, 250-251).

Later, bans and new textbook guidelines sought to limit and control the educational materials available to Germans. History education was censored, especially in the lower grades."

Even these protestations were hardly the flames of fierce resistance. Meinecke even wrote in an article for a newspaper that “there are many worthwhile ideas, strengths, and men in this movement” (252). Underappreciation of the threat of Nazism characterized the early attitude of historians. In fact, Hitler promised much of what most wanted: a revitalized *Reich* under strong autocratic leadership. 

And so, as the new regime began the ['*Gleichschaltung*'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleichschaltung) (coordination) of the universities and 15% of the teaching staff in Germany was dismissed following a new law promulgated on April 7, 1933, there was no public, collective opposition on the part of historians nor intellectuals in general (253-254). Outwardly, historians were effectively cowed, either by threat of joblessness or by some measure of approval of the Third Reich. The conquest of the German historians' body complete, the Nazis moved on to conquer the mind. This turned out to be a far more formidable task.

### The “Nazi School” of History

  image-url="mmendoza-mitteleuropa.jpg"
  source-url="https://www.flickr.com/photos/35468140263@N01/9028101"
%}

For the Nazi program of radical mass political indoctrination to suceed it needed a commanding influence in the schools, and history education was to be at the forefront of this effort, as in fact directed by the Reich Minister of the Interior on May 9, 1933. Another decree later in the same year established new “Guidelines for History Textbooks” that emphasized race as the driving factor underlying history and focused on leadership and heroism in the struggle between peoples and nations (Evans, “In Power” 263).

In the Nazi '*Weltanschauung*' (worldview), history was conceived of as a Manichean struggle between mutually antagonistic racial forces of the natural versus the parasitic (invariably equated especially with the Jews), an almost impossible struggle that could only be won through the contributions of heroic deeds (Ayçoberry, 5). Everything was subordinated to the service of the German *volk* in this struggle, including history itself, which was wielded as a cudgel to mold a new generation of young Germans in the National Socialist image. The notion that history should have any pretenses of objectivity at all were jettisoned as a “liberal fallacy” (Evans, “In Power” 263). Curriculums were slimmed to exclude “pointless detail” and focus instead on promoting nationalism (273).

### “Obliterate the Traces”

Historians who wholeheartedly embraced Nazism simply discarded the past. Nations had no real progression in history, as “they are already there, prefigured” and could only degenerate (Ayçoberry, 6). Thus, Charlemagne was considered unequivocally German, having “created the Empire” a thousand years before the unification (Evans, “In Power" 312). The [Germanic migrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_Period) were supposedly proof of German racial superiority (Ayçoberry, 7). According to Moritz Edelmann in 1937, editor of a historical journal, historical investigation should “liberate itself from the dependence on the written source” (Schulze, 26).

%}

Medieval history was especially distorted to these ends, an idealized pre-Christian “empire” of Charlemagne virtuous only as a foreshadowing of the new *Reich*, the Teutonic knights revered as a model of German expansion to the east. As the philosopher and sociologist [Max Horkheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Horkheimer) explained, “fascism, by its very exaltation of the past, is antihistorical. The Nazis' references to history mean only that the powerful must rule and that there is no emancipation from the eternal laws which guide humanity. When they say history, they mean its very opposite: mythology” (Ayçoberry, 7).

The mythologizing of history was not restricted to academic circles. Historical films were especially prized by the Nazis as a means of communicating National Socialist ideals to a mass audience by relying heavily on symbolism. Screenwriters were directed to focus on “the progress of the Nordic man in history. The end of Antiquity, starting point of the alien mind… priests and kings in a struggle for world hegemony… the elements of degenerescence… (liberalism, capitalism, Marxism, confessionalism)...” (Ayçoberry, 10).

The film *The Eternal Forest* (1936) extolled the soil as source of Germanic values, depicting Germanic forests as having endured hardship through war and industrial deforestation but also “humiliated by the occupation of Negro soldiers” (a reference to the [Occupation of the Rhineland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Rhineland) by French colonial soldiers between 1918 and 1930) just as the German people had been (11). The idealization and romanticism of pastoralism (“soil”) juxtaposed with militant struggle and industrial warfare (“blood”) reveals one of the many contradictions inherent to the Nazi *Weltanschauung*. Though the source of Germanic values was supposedly the soil and the peasant, the heroes of National Socialism would come from the cities, bedecked in an intensely materialist, racist ideology (8-9).

Riefenstahl pioneered the art of film propaganda, heavily utilizing symbolism and novel filmmaking techniques such as slow motion, extremely high and low angles, sweeping panoramas, and tracking shots, which can be seen here. The eclectic and crude psuedotheories of the Nazis proved amply compatible with the style of Riefenstahl."

### Tacit Resistance

In spite of mounting pressure from various Nazified organizations to incorporate *Volksgeschichte* into all forms of historical scholarship, no unified “Nazi Historiography” ever emerged. As in other aspects of the Third Reich, Hitler preferred to leave the jurisdictions of subordinate organizations intentionally vague, promoting infighting that prevented any one agent from gaining too much power; as such the term “Nazi School” is misleading. There were many voices of authority on such matters, among them the Education Ministry, the “Institute of New Germany,” [Alfred Rosenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Rosenberg) (c. 1893-1946, a leading Nazi ideologist executed after the war at the Nuremberg Trials for war crimes), and the *SS* under Himmler (6). Understandings of history from a *volk*-centered approach proliferated, but never completely overtook state-centered approaches (Schönwälder, 148). The methodologies of professional historians proved resistant to the efforts of ideologues to assimilate complex and sophisticated scholarship into crudely-defined Nazi concepts (Evans, “In Power” 312).

In the end, this is precisely what happened."

%}

Historians resistant to Nazism who chose not to emigrate often dealt with the onslaught through an outward demeanor of conformity to the new regime---an “unpolitical” affectation that was familiar to historians of the Rankean tradition. One educator modified the Nazi greeting to his students in thinly-veiled sarcasm as “Hail, you Ancient Germanic Tribesmen!” (Evans, “In Power” 266). Historians more often avoided controversial subjects and preferred instead to focus their energies on eras far removed from present politics (Schulze, 27). Prominent examples of this “inner emigration” included that of Friedrich Meinecke’s *The Rise of Historicism* and Gerhard Ritter’s books on Martin Luther and Frederick the Great, two figures exalted by the Nazis---though Ritter in defiance formulated these works as repudiations of Nazi ideology (Sims, 257). As noted by the *SS* in 1938, the vast majority of historians continued their research unabated by political events, carrying on “compiling old scholarly encyclopedias” and delivering “new scholarly contributions to the illumination of individual epochs” (Evans, “In Power” 313).

On the whole, therefore, efforts to Nazify the history profession were largely unsuccessful within the academic sphere. Nazi psuedotheories did not hold up to the methodological and theoretical rigor of professional historians. Even the *Historische Zeitschrift*, though compromised in some respects (publishing articles like those on the “Jewish Question”) continued to publish conventional articles untainted by Nazism. When the premier national, annual historical conference became dominated by committed Nazis, most historians simply did not attend any longer (313). Even those initially pleased with the new regime eventually became involved in conflict with local Nazi appointees or zealous student organizations. It is not always so clear where compliance ended and dissent began. However, seen from outside of Germany, historical scholarship was nonetheless severely curtailed in areas that criticized far-right conceptions of history (Schulze, 29).

## Post-War Nazi Influences

The cataclysmic end of the war for Germany resulted in a crisis of historical scholarship. There were widespread calls to reexamine conventional historical theses. In this respect, 1945 really did seem like a complete break with the past, “the end of traditional history” (Schulze, 31). What did “German history” mean in an era without a German state? West German historians insisted that modern scholarship could continue as “true” history released from the trappings of Nazi rhetoric, as it was claimed that many had simply paid lip-service to Nazi ideology to retain their jobs. But the extent to which Nazi-era historiography affected post-war methodologies was indeed in question.

Historians and the public at large struggled with what that meant for the continuation of German history."

%}

Undoubtedly, paradigm shifts initiated during the Nazi era found some forms of continuity with post-war scholarship. *Volksgeschichte* in particular retained a powerful influence on the social sciences post-war (Schönwälder, 142-143). No longer were historical shifts primarily conceptualized as arising from politics and the state, but rather from society---a tradition firmly rooted in *völkish* analysis, drawing a clear connection between paradigms of the 1930s and those of the 1960s (Schulze, 20).

There was a widespread post-war consensus among both historians and the general public that a thorough revision of German history was needed, the search for the "junction" where German history "began to err from its path" (30). But this began to wane as the new West German Federal Republic gained solid political standing, the majority of historians preferring to return to "normalcy" and continuity in scholarship. And though a degree of "traditional" historical debate did return, retreading familiar ground like that of the Bismark era, it was clear that the post-war historical paradigm had been irrevocably altered. Focus on *Volksgeschichte* during the National Socialist era had, for better or worse, brought about the "social revolution" that had been so delayed in Germany by the failure of the revolutions of 1848 and 1918 (38).

It was from this tug-of-war between traditionalist historians and the younger generations over what history had been tainted by the Nazis and should be jettisoned that the beginnings of a decades-long "Historians Debate" emerged. That debate continues to smolder in certain respects even today, as German historians struggle to come to terms with their profession's complicity in the origins and the genocidal actions of the Nazi regime in those darkest years of German history.

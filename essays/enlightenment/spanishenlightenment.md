## What about Spain? 
When we think about the Enlightenment what comes to mind? It’s usually names like Voltaire, John Locke, and Immanuel Kant. And when we think of geologically about where the Enlightenment took place we usually go in our minds to England, France and Germany, and even Scotland and the Scottish Enlightenment. While there is a lot of meat to chew on with these major Enlightenment Figures and where they were from in Europe, we have to wonder for a second where is Spain’s place in the Enlightenment? Or was there Enlightenment Ideas taking place in Spain at all? Was Spain some sort of dark space where the rest of Europe was lighting up with Enlightenment ideas while Spain was toiling in darkness. In fact Spain did have a place in the Enlightenment but just in a different way that was nuanced and under the radar but it did in fact happen as we go through this meta-history we will see some of the major historical writers who influenced Spain during the enlightenment like Guizot, and Vico and also look at the leader ship of Spain at the time particularly looking at King Charles the 5th and his policies and how they affected Spain and its relationships with the rest of Europe and Spain’s colonies in the Americas. After that we will move on to Spanish Colonialism and how some of Spain’s Enlightenment policies affected Spanish Colonies in the New World and look at some different examples from Cuba to the Philippines and the legacy of colonialism and the effects of the Spanish Enlightenment on the people and land of the former Spanish Empire.

Now let’s dive into the two Historians who had some of the most influence in Spain 

Giambattista Vico (Born June 23 1668, Died January 23, 1774)- He was more often than not credited with the creation of “the philosophy of history” which was broken down as the sturdy of past in all its forms. Philosophy of History uses the best theories in core subjects of Philosophy or Religion in order to get a better understanding of the subject as a whole. “Thus Vico became the first to chart a course of History that depended on the way the structure of thought changed over time.”(IEP.com/Vico,1) ) In order to show the difference between modern thought and the way the ancients  thought Vico also developed another theory of imagination. “This theory led to an account of myth based on ritual and imitation that would resemble some twentieth century anthropological theories.”(IEP.com/Vico,1) Vico was also interested in how class struggle affected older societies that he studied and this would pre date some famous class studies historians and Philosophers like Marx and James Joyce. A big reason why Vico isn’t more revered by modern readers is because his work can be difficult to understand. “Further, he is heavily influenced by a number of traditions that many philosophers may find unfamiliar:the natural law tradition of thinkers like Grotius; the Roman rhetorical tradition of authors like Quintilian; and the current science and anthropology of his day.” (iep.utm.edu/Vico). Now moving on the most important thing to take from Vico is that he was anti Enlightenment. “Vico is rightfully cast as a counter Enlightenment thinker. In the face of the Enlightenment emphasis doing natural science through the search from clear and distinct ideas, Vico saw himself as a defender of rhetoric and humanism.”(IEP.utm.edu/Vico) 

Next we need to look at the other Historian who was a major influence in Spain and that was Francois Guizot 

Francois Guizot (Born October 4, 1787, Died October 12,1784) He was a French political figure. Guizot was a major proponent of constitutional monarchy as  the proper form of government to pursue. “Guizot spent the years of 1820-30 mostly in historical research, producing works such as Histore de la Civilisation en Europe. 3 vol and Histoire de las civilization en France, Vol 5. His historical interpretations generally reflected his political attachment to limited representation and constitutional monarchy.” (Britannica, The Editors Encyclopedia. “Francois Guizot”) Guizot was a big believer in primary education for French youth. “IN 1832-37 Guizot was minister of Education and was responsible for the so called Guizot Law (1833), which established the principle that secular primary education should be accessible to all citizens.” (Britannica, The Editors Encyclopedia. “Francois Guizot”) this is a major point to see because at the time Spain was dealing with how to go about education in its own Country because during this time Spain had most of its schooling in the hands of the Jesuits which were a sect of Catholicism. 


When we look at Spain we have to remember what a large and overbearing influence the Catholic Church was in the ability for information and Ideas to be distributed within Spain and its intellectual circles. The ruling elites at the time the Bourbon who had strong ties to France were looking to reform Spain Historian Gabriel Paquette goes on to say, “The transmission and assimilation of foreign ideas occurred as much through traditional conduits including published translations, as via first hand observations of practices institutions and legislation.” (Paquette, 55). Spanish Enlightenment in many ways was done by a concept called “emulation” where Spanish Government officials and leading thinkers of the time would emulate ideas from France mostly when it came to the Enlightenment that was taking place in the country.

### Spanish Enlightenment and the Colonial Archive 
Next 
Andres Gonzales de Barcia (Born 1673, Died 1743, Was a archivist Americanist he was one of the first publishers of a History of the Americas and West Indies. In Jonathan Carlyon’s book Andres Gonzales de Barcia and the Creation of the Colonial Spanish American Library. This was according to Carlyon the first phase of the creation of the first phase of scholarship on the Histography of the Indies. “ In an attempt to confront the obstacle to scholarship Gonzalez de Barcia undertook an editorial project that would result in the creation of editions of what he considered to be some of Spain’s most important Chronicles of the Indies.” (Carlyon, 19,20) Carlyon later goes on to describe how Gonzalez went about his work “Gonzalez de Barcia expected his intellectual peers to publish well-researched scholarship. He believed however, that the final product of study depended on the sources used during the investigation.” (Carlyon, 22) Gonzalez de Barcia believed strongly in well done research and that in turn helped the quality of the work that he did. However at the time of his research it was always under scrutiny of of the royal leadership. “In dedication to Phillip V in Gonzalez de Barcia 1723 edition of Il Inca Garcilaso de la Vega’s Comentarios Reales, the publisher Nicholas Rodriguez Franco, explained the importance to the Spanish monarchy of Gonzalez de Barcia’s editorial mission Of all the royal titles held by King, Rodriquez Franco stated that “the greatest, and most elegant Title is the Protection of the Heroes, who with their deeds gave Life to such a Great History, conserving for themselves the Glorious Light of Immortality, in the Royal shadow of your Excellency.” (Carlyon, 23) we see here that the state has a large influence it what ultimately makes it into the History as well and that can be a problem when we are looking for a clear picture when it comes to scholarship and clarity.
